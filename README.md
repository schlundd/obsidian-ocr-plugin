## Further remarks

The process of extracting texts from images does not happen locally, but uses an online service. This makes the extraction high-quality and available on all devices.

A usage limit may be enforced on free accounts. If you are unsure about whether you may hit these limits, you probably won't, but there is also a paid plan available, if you do.
